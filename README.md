# AutoScaleSprite

Using sprites with Pixi (React pixi) can be complicated if you don't have control of the dimensions.

This library will calculate and set up the dimensions (width/height) of the sprites keeping always the same pixel ratio.

Check the docs (docz) for the examples.


## NOTE

### For now:

This has not been published yet to npm.
Not tested other than visually tested using docz.
